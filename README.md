# 🏛️ AI-Powered Unified Citizen Service & Welfare Platform

An AI-driven Civic-Tech Super App designed to bridge the gap between Indian citizens and government services by simplifying access to welfare schemes, certificates, and public services—especially for rural and low-digital-literacy users.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Millions of Indian citizens are unaware of government schemes they are eligible for or struggle to apply due to:
- Fragmented government portals
- Complex procedures and paperwork
- Language and literacy barriers
- Lack of guidance and digital access

As a result, benefits fail to reach the intended population, leading to inequality and inefficiency in public service delivery.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The **AI-Powered Unified Citizen Service & Welfare Platform** acts as a single, intelligent interface between citizens and government systems.

The platform:
- Recommends eligible government schemes
- Explains schemes in simple local languages
- Predicts eligibility using AI
- Automates document handling and form filling
- Guides users via voice-based and chatbot interfaces
- Supports offline access and last-mile connectivity

The solution evolves into an **Agentic AI system** capable of executing end-to-end workflows such as applying for certificates and updating identity documents.
